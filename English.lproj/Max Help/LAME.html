<span class="header">MP3 Encoder Information</span>
<p>Max uses the <a href="http://mp3dev.org">LAME</a> encoding engine to generate MP3 files.  LAME is an high-quality, open-source encoding engine.</p>

<p>Much of the following information was taken from an <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=28124">HydrogenAudio</a> forum post regarding LAME quality at various settings.</p>

<span class="header">Bitrate Information</span>
<p>
At a given bitrate range, the quality scale is following: VBR is higher quality than ABR which is higher quality than CBR (VBR > ABR > CBR in terms of quality). The exception to this is when you choose the highest possible CBR bitrate, which is 320 kbps.</p>

<p><dl><dt>VBR</dt>
<dd>Variable Bitrate Mode: the goal is to keep a constant quality, and saving bits where possible without lowering the quality. Size is less predictable than with ABR, but the quality is usually better.</dd>
<dt>ABR</dt>
<dd>Average Bitrate Mode: varies bits around a specified target bitrate</dd>
<dt>CBR</dt>
<dd>Constant Bitrate Mode: is not efficient regarding distributing bitrate to more complex music parts, and saving bits where it would be possible without lowering the quality of those music parts.</dd></dl><p>

<span class="header">Configuring MP3 Output</span>
<p>To generate an average bitrate (ABR) MP3, set the LAME target to Bitrate and choose the desired ABR using the slider.  To encode a constant bitrate (CBR) file, set the LAME target to Bitrate and choose the desired CBR using the slider as above, but check the <em>Restrict encoder to constant bitrate</em> checkbox.</p>
<p>To generate a variable bitrate file (VBR) file, set the LAME target to quality and choose the desired quality using the slider.  Quality settings of 70-100 should produce transparent encodings. For those used to LAME on the command line, a quality setting of 100 equates to <tt>-V 0</tt> while a quality setting of 0 equates to <tt>-V 10</tt>.</p>

<span class="header">Quick Start</span>
<p>
<strong>Best Quality: archiving</strong><br />
320 kbps, constant bitrate (<tt>-b 320</tt>)<br />
This is the strongest setting for MP3, with the lowest risk of artifacts.
With the exception of a few situations, quality is rarely better than the highest VBR profiles described below.
Alternative: Lossless formats like WavPack, Flac etc allow true archiving bit for bit like on original CD.</p>

<p>
<strong>High Quality: HiFi, home or quiet listening</strong><br />
Quality 70, Fast mode (<tt>-V 3 --vbr-new</tt>) (~175 kbps)<br />
Quality 80, Fast mode (<tt>-V 2 --vbr-new</tt>) (~190 kbps)<br />
Quality 90, Fast mode (<tt>-V 1 --vbr-new</tt>) (~210 kbps)<br />
Quality 100, Fast mode (<tt>-V 0 --vbr-new</tt>) (~230 kbps) are recommended.<br />
These settings will produce transparent encoding (transparent = most people cannot distinguish the mp3 from the original in an ABX blindtest).
Audible differences between these presets exist, but are extremely marginal.</p>

<p>
<strong>Portable: background noise and low bitrate requirement, small sizes</strong><br />
Quality 40, Fast mode (<tt>-V6 --vbr-new</tt>) (~115 kbps)<br />
Quality 50, Fast mode (<tt>-V5 --vbr-new</tt>) (~130 kbps)<br />
Quality 60, Fast mode (<tt>-V4 --vbr-new</tt>) (~160 kbps) are recommended for this use.<br />
Quality 40, Fast mode (<tt>-V6 --vbr-new</tt>) produces an acceptable quality, while Quality 60, Fast mode (<tt>-V4--vbr-new</tt>) should be close to perceptual transparency.</p>

<p>
<strong>Very low bitrate, small sizes: eg. for voice, radio, mono encoding etc.</strong><br />
Bitrate XXX (<tt>--abr xx</tt>)<br />
For very low bitrates, up to 100kbps, ABR is most often the best solution.
</p>

<span class="header">Fast vs. Standard Mode</span>
<p>
In Max, Fast mode equates to <tt>--vbr-new</tt>.<br />
LAME will encode much faster compared to old/default vbr mode. Current knowledge qualitywise comparing vbr with --vbr-new is, that --vbr-new might even be better qualitywise than the default vbr mode, but there are also reports about artefact, which is worse in --vbr-new compared to default. The general impression is, that --vbr-new should be recommended over vbr-default. --vbr-new can be faster and at equal/better quality at same time, because it uses a different algorithm than old/default vbr mode.</p>
