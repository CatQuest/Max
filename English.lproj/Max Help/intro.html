<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Max is a CD ripper and audio encoder for Mac OS X.  It provides a simple, clean interface to your CDs and allows creation of high-quality audio in various formats from them.</p>

<p>Transferring audio from your CD to your computer consists of two steps: ripping and encoding.  During the ripping process, Max extracts the raw PCM data from your CD and writes it to a temporary file.  This process provides optional error, skip and jitter correction that comes about from damaged CDs or imperfect drives.   During the encoding process, Max converts the extracted PCM audio into the desired format.  Max can encode audio in MP3, FLAC, and Ogg Vorbis formats from a single input file.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The simplest way to encode audio is to insert a CD, select the tracks you wish to encode, and click the encode button in the toolbar.  The default settings will generate 128 kbps average bitrate (ABR) MP3 files to your Music folder using error correction during ripping, and place the files in an iTunes&#8482; compatible format.</p>

<p>Most users will want to customize the output generated by Max, such as changing the audio quality, generated file formats, file naming scheme, or the output location.  Max provides full control over these parameters and more in the Preferences.  For more information on MP3 encoding options, see the <a href="LAME.html">MP3 encoder</a> page.  For information on Ogg Vorbis encoding options, see the <a href="OggVorbis.html">Ogg Vorbis encoder</a> page.</p>
