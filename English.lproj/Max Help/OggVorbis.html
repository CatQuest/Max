<h2>Configuring Ogg Vorbis Output</h2>
<h3>Generating VBR Output</h3>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: VBR is the preferred encoding method for Ogg Vorbis.  It is highly recommended to use this setting for most applications.<br /><br />To generate a variable bitrate file (VBR) file, set the Target to Quality and choose the desired quality using the slider.  Quality settings of 5-6 should produce transparent encodings.</p>

<h2>Ogg Vorbis Playback Information</h2>
<p>While Ogg Vorbis is not yet supported natively on Mac OS X, the <a href="http://www.xiph.org/quicktime/">XiphQT</a> components allow Ogg Vorbis playback from any Quicktime&#8482;-enabled application such as iTunes&#8482;.</p>

<h2>Ogg Vorbis Encoder Information</h2>
<p>Max uses the <a href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/">libVorbis</a> encoding engine to generate Ogg Vorbis files.  Ogg Vorbis is an high-quality, open-source audio format.</p>

<p>The following information was taken from the <a href="http://vorbis.com/faq/">Vorbis FAQ</a>.</p>

  <dt><a href="#_lossy" id="lossy">I've heard that Vorbis is a &#x201c;lossy&#x201d;
  codec. What does this mean?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>There are two broad classes of compression algorithms:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>lossy</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Lossy compression algorithms <em>discard</em> data in order to compress it
    better than would normally be possible. Examples include <abbr>JPEG</abbr>,
    Vorbis, and <abbr>MP3</abbr> compression.</dd>

    <dt><dfn>lossless</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Lossless compression algorithms produce compressed data that can be decoded to
    output that is identical to the original. Zip is a common general-purpose lossless
    compression format; <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a> is a lossless
    compression format that is specifically designed for audio.</dd>
  </dl><p/>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="#_sound" id="sound">Does Ogg Vorbis sound better than MP3?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>Yes, definitely. Naturally, we invite you to judge this for yourself;
  please see our <a href='http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/listen.html'>Dare to Compare</a>
  page for at least some of our listening samples.</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="#_other" id="other">Why is Ogg Vorbis better than the other "New MP3"
  codecs that are available?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>Vorbis sounds better. Vorbis is open, so you're free to use it on your favorite
  platform. Vorbis doesn't have intellectual property restrictions to get in the way.
  And Vorbis doesn't just try to sound better, it tries to do things fundamentally better
  in all the ways that it can.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="#_transcode" id="transcode">Can I convert my MP3 collection to the Ogg
  Vorbis format?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>You can convert any audio format to Ogg Vorbis. However, converting from one
  lossy format, like MP3, to another lossy format, like Vorbis, is generally a bad idea.
  Both MP3 and Vorbis encoders achieve high compression ratios by throwing away parts
  of the audio waveform that you probably won't hear. However, the MP3 and Vorbis
  codecs are very different, so they each will throw away different parts of the audio,
  although there certainly is some overlap. Converting a MP3 to Vorbis involves decoding
  the MP3 file back to an uncompressed format, like WAV, and recompressing it using the Ogg
  Vorbis encoder. The decoded MP3 will be missing the parts of the original audio that
  the MP3 encoder chose to discard. The Ogg Vorbis encoder will then discard other audio
  components when it compresses the data. At best, the result will be an Ogg file that
  sounds the same as your original MP3, but it is most likely that the resulting file will
  sound worse than your original MP3. In no case will you get a file that sounds better
  than the original MP3.</p>
  <p>Since many music players can play both MP3 <em>and</em> Ogg files, there is no reason
  that you should have to switch all of your files to one format or the other. If you like
  Ogg Vorbis, then we would encourage you to use it when you encode from original, lossless
  audio sources (like CDs). When encoding from originals, you will find that you can make
  Ogg files that are smaller or of better quality (or both) than your MP3s.</p>
  <p>(If you must absolutely must convert from MP3 to Ogg, there are several conversion
  scripts available on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=convert%20ogg%20mp3">Freshmeat</a>

  <dt><a href="#_test" id="test">You're claiming that Vorbis has great audio quality.
  Have you done any listening tests to back this up?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>Yes. Have a look at our <a href='http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/listen.html'>Dare
  to Compare</a> page.</p>
  <p>Further, the German magazine c't published the results of a
  <a hreflang='de' href='http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/anw-08.09.02-000/'>listening test</a>
  which found that Vorbis sounded better than MP3 at lower bitrates/quality settings
  (around 64kbit/sec).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="#_bugs" id="bugs">I've heard some test samples that had audible
  artifacts. Why did this happen?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>While the Vorbis file format is standardized, the Vorbis encoder has
  undergone several beta and prerelease testing cycles. If the files you heard were
  encoded using an earlier version encoder, they might contain serious audio quality bugs
  that have already been fixed. Try re-encoding from the source audio using the latest
  encoder. If you still think you've got a bug that produces unreasonable artifacts, please
  e-mail the vorbis-dev list with the details.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="#_quality" id="quality">What does the &#x201c;Quality&#x201d; setting mean?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>Vorbis' audio quality is not <em>best</em> measured in kilobits per second, but
  on a scale from -1 to 10 called "quality". This change in terminology was brought about
  by a tuning of the variable-bitrate algorithm that produces better sound quality for a
  given average bitrate, but which does not adhere as strictly to that average as a target.</p>
  <p>This new scale of measurement is not tied to a quantifiable characteristic of the
  stream, like bitrate, so it's a fairly subjective metric, but provides a more stable
  basis of comparison to other codecs and is relatively future-proof. As Segher Boessenkool
  explained, &#x201c;if you upgrade to a new vorbis encoder, and you keep the same quality
  setting, you will get smaller files which sound the same. If you keep the same nominal
  bitrate, you get about the same size files, which sound somewhat better.&#x201d; The
  former behavior is the aim of the quality metric, so encoding to a target bitrate is
  now officially deprecated for all uses except streaming over bandwidth-critical
  connections.</p>
  <p>For now, quality 0 is roughly equivalent to 64kbps average, 5 is roughly 160kbps,
  and 10 gives about 400kbps. Most people seeking very-near-CD-quality audio encode at
  a quality of 5 or, for lossless stereo coupling, 6. The default setting is quality
  3, which at approximately 110kbps gives a smaller filesize and significantly better
  fidelity than .mp3 compression at 128kbps.</p>
  <p>As always, if you need CD-quality sound, neither Vorbis nor MP3 (nor any other
  lossy audio codec) can provide <em>exact</em> reproduction; instead, consider using
  a lossless audio compression scheme like <a href='http://flac.sourceforge.net'>FLAC</a>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="#_speech" id="speech">How does Vorbis fare for speech compression?</a></dt>
  <dd><p>It works well, but is generally not the optimal solution. Vorbis is designed
  for the compression of music and general purpose audio. Special purpose codecs can
  achieve much greater compression of speech than Vorbis. Vorbis also tends to have a
  latency that is too high for telephony, a common use of speech codecs. Read the
  <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/comp.speech/FAQ3.html">Speech Coding and Compression
  FAQ</a> for more details. Those looking for an pen-source, patent-free speech codec
  should take a look at <a href="http://www.speex.org/">Speex</a>.</p>
